# APMC_web_scraping 
This is the code developed to extract agricultural commodity daily prices from Pune APMC website for the data analysis. 
I have chosen 4 main agricultural commodities for analysis which are Onion, Potato, Garlic, and Ginger. 
This is not fully automated code, have to put a value of D = ('2385') which is page no. of that website which is to be incremented manually each time.
also, another variable R=(4) which is row no. of the excel workbook, you need to increment this no buy one each time.
