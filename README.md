# Pune APMC_web_scraping 
This is the code developed to extract agricultural commodity daily prices from Pune APMC website for the data analysis. 
I have chosen 4 main agricultural commodities in Maharashtra for analysis which are Onion, Potato, Garlic, and Ginger. 
This is not fully automated code, you have to increment the value of D = ('2385') manually each time which is page no. of that website.
Also, another variable R=(4) which is row no. of the excel workbook, you need to increment this no by one each time and then run the code.
This Code returns the date, commodity arrivals, min price, and max price of commodity to the excel file which is already created locally. (APMC1.csv)
